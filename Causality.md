*Question 1:*
>Suppose you believe that two variable X and Y are related, but you have no idea which way the causality goes. Does X cause Y or vice versa (or maybe even neither)? Can you tell by regressing Y on X and then regressing X on Y? Explain. Also provide at least one real example where the direction of causality would be ambiguous.

*Answer:*
>Given that X and Y are related and have no idea which way the causality goes, there is no valid way to find the causality between the variables. The main reason why we can’t say X causes Y or Y causes X is due to the common saying that ‘correlation does not imply causation’. To dive deeper into the meaning of this saying, one must understand the difference between the terms. Correlation is a statistical measurement that indicates the strength of a linear relationship between a pair of variables (Albright and Winston, 2017). In this question, we are told that X and Y are related meaning that some sort of correlation exists between the two variables, but not the why and how the relationship unfolded. Causation, on the other hand, is similar to the idea of cause and effect. Causality between two variables argues that any change to a value of one variable will cause a change in the value of the other variable. With the given information, there lacks evidence that if a value of the x-variable is changed that the value in y-variable will also change and vise versa. As far as regression analysis goes, there are “two potential objective of regression analysis: to understand how the world operates and to make predictions” (Albright and Winston, 2017). Even with successfully regressing Y on X and then X on Y, will only construct information on how strong of predictions we can make of one variable based on a single explanatory variable. Comparing this to the idea of causality, regression analysis is a technique where one can predict values based on a single explanatory variable, therefore, it does not give any valid explanation whether or not a variable causes another variable. In conclusion, neither X causes Y nor Y causes X. This cannot be seen by regression analysis between the two variables because regression predictions are different from true causation. 

>There is a classic example where the direction of causality would be ambiguous due to the idea that ‘correlation does not imply causation’. This example is the correlation between ice cream sales and the rate of murders. While one is a dessert and one is a violent crime, “summer is when people get together. More specifically, casual drinkers and drug users are more likely to go to bars or parties on weekends and evenings, as opposed to a Tuesday morning. These people in the social mix, flooding the city’s streets and neighborhood bars, feed the peak times for murder, experts say” (Peters, 2013).  Summer is also known as the peak time of ice cream sales. Thus, one can argue that ice cream sales and murder rates are correlated. This is a prime example of how the direction of causality would be ambiguous:
  *	Just because an individual buys an ice cream, does not ***cause*** a murder.
  *	Just because there is a murder, does not ***cause*** an ice cream purchase.
> This mere statistical coincidence shows that just because two variables are correlated does not mean one causes the other and vice versa. For that reason, the ice cream sales and murder rates example demonstrates how the direction of causality would be ambiguous.
